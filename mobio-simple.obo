name: mobile genetic element
def: "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are a type of genetic material, a segment of DNA or RNA, that is capable of movement around a genome or that can be transferred from one species or replicon to another. These include transposons, plasmids, bacteriophages, and genomic islands. The mechanism of movement may be self-encoded or may rely on other enzymes and structures, such as a pilus. In bacteria, MGEs are often associated with the movement of antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors from one species to another, for example by plasmid-mediated transfer." []

def: "A plasmid is a small, circular, double-stranded DNA molecule that is distinct from a cell's chromosomal DNA. Plasmids naturally exist in bacterial cells, and they also occur in some eukaryotes. Often, the genes carried in plasmids provide bacteria with genetic advantages, such as antibiotic resistance. Plasmids have a wide range of lengths, from roughly one thousand DNA base pairs to hundreds of thousands of base pairs." []

def: "Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits. In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon. Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability. Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity."

A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits. In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon. Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability. Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity."
