Those natural – as contrasted with engineered, which here means: deliberately executed – units which do exist in the realm of occurrents are typically either parasitic on the existence of natural units on the continuant side, or they are fiat in nature. Thus we can count lives; we can count football games; we can count chemical reactions performed in experiments or in chemical manufacturing. We cannot count the processes taking place, for instance, in an episode of insect mating behavior.Even where natural units are identifiable, for example cycles in a cyclical process such as the beating of a heart or an organism’s sleep/wake cycle, the processes in question form a sequence with no discontinuities (temporal gaps) of the sort that we find for instance where billiard balls or zebrafish or planets are separated by clear spatial gaps. Lives of organisms are process units, but they too unfold in a continuous series from other, prior processes such as fertilization, and they unfold in turn in continuous series of post-life processes such as post-mortem decay.

Such units play a central role in almost all domains of natural science from particle physics to cosmology. Many scientific laws govern the units in question, employing general terms (such as ‘molecule’ or ‘planet’) referring to the types and subtypes of units, and also to the types and subtypes of the processes through which such units develop and interact. The division of reality into such natural units is at the heart of biological science, as also is the fact that these units may form higher-level units (as cells form multicellular organisms) and that they may also form aggregates of units, for example as cells form portions of tissue and organs form families, herds, breeds, species, and so on. At the same time, the division of certain portions of reality into engineered units (manufactured artifacts) is the basis of modern industrial technology, which rests on the distributed mass production of engineered parts through division of labor and on their assembly into larger, compound units such as cars and laptops.

def: "Toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits. In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon. Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability. Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity."

Increased transcription rate of relBE and activation of relE is consistent with a lower level of RelB in starved cells due to degradation of RelB by protease Lon.RelE is the toxic component of a type II toxin-antitoxin (TA) module. A sequence-specific, ribosome-dependent mRNA endoribonuclease that inhibits translation during amino acid starvation (the stringent response). In vitro acts by cleaving mRNA with high codon specificity in the ribosomal A site between positions 2 and 3. The stop codon UAG is cleaved at a fast rate while UAA and UGA are cleaved with intermediate and slow rates. In vitro mRNA cleavage can also occur in the ribosomal E site after peptide release from peptidyl-tRNA in the P site as well as on free 30S subunits. In vivo cuts frequently in the first 100 codons, most frequently after the second and third base and rarely near the stop codon. Overexpression of RelE results in the inhibition of bacterial growth and a sharp decrease in colony-forming ability which is neutralized by the labile cognate antitoxin RelB. Overexpression also sharply increases persisters (cells that neither grow nor die in the presence of bactericidal agents and are largely responsible for high levels of biofilm tolerance to antimicrobials). Plays a role in dormancy when expressed in high-density cells in the absence of antitoxin RelB; amino acid starvation and an unidentified extracellular factor promote dormancy, while expression of antitoxin RelB restores cell culturability. Acts with RelB as a corepressor of relBE transcription, considerably increasing the repression of RelB alone. 2 RelB dimers bind to 2 operator sequences; DNA-binding and repression is stronger when complexed with toxin/corepressor RelE by conditional cooperativity."

comment: Note that this relation was previously called "inheres in", but was changed to be called "characteristic of" because BFO2 uses "inheres in" in a more restricted fashion. This relation differs from BFO2:inheres_in in two respects: (1) it does not impose a range constraint, and thus it allows qualities of processes, as well as of information entities, whereas BFO2 restricts inheres_in to only apply to independent continuants (2) it is declared functional, i.e. something can only be a characteristic of one thing.

property_value: IAO:0000116 "This branch of the ontology deals with causal relations between entities. It is divided into two branches: causal relations between occurrents/processes, and causal relations between material entities. We take an 'activity flow-centric approach', with the former as primary, and define causal relations between material entities in terms of causal relations between occurrents.\n\nTo define causal relations in an activity-flow type network, we make use of 3 primitives:\n\n * Temporal: how do the intervals of the two occurrents relate? \n * Is the causal relation regulatory?\n * Is the influence positive or negative?\n\nThe first of these can be formalized in terms of the Allen Interval Algebra. Informally, the 3 bins we care about are 'direct', 'indirect' or overlapping. Note that all causal relations should be classified under a RO temporal relation (see the branch under 'temporally related to'). Note that all causal relations are temporal, but not all temporal relations are causal. Two occurrents can be related in time without being causally connected. We take causal influence to be primitive, elucidated as being such that has the upstream changed, some qualities of the donwstream would necessarily be modified.\n\nFor the second, we consider a relationship to be regulatory if the system in which the activities occur is capable of altering the relationship to achieve some objective. This could include changing the rate of production of a molecule.\n\nFor the third, we consider the effect of the upstream process on the output(s) of the downstream process. If the level of output is increased, or the rate of production of the output is increased, then the direction is increased. Direction can be positive, negative or neutral or capable of either direction. Two positives in succession yield a positive, two negatives in succession yield a positive, otherwise the default assumption is that the net effect is canceled and the influence is neutral.\n\nEach of these 3 primitives can be composed to yield a cross-product of different relation types." xsd:string
